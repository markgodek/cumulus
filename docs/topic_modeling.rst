Topic modeling
--------------------

Prepare input data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Follow the steps below to run **topic_modeling** on Terra_.

1. Prepare your count matrix. **Cumulus** currently supports the following formats:  ‘zarr’, ‘h5ad’, ‘loom’, ‘10x’, ‘mtx’, ‘csv’, ‘tsv’ and ‘fcs’ (for flow/mass cytometry data) formats


2. Upload your count matrix to the workspace.

    Example::
    
        gsutil cp /foo/bar/projects/dataset.h5ad gs://fc-e0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/

    where ``/foo/bar/projects/dataset.h5ad`` is the path to your dataset on your local machine, and
    ``gs://fc-e0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/`` is the Google bucket destination.

3. Import *topic_modeling* workflow to your workspace.

    See the Terra documentation for `adding a workflow`_. The *cumulus* workflow is under ``Broad Methods Repository`` with name "**cumulus/topic_modeling**".

    Moreover, in the workflow page, click the ``Export to Workspace...`` button, and select the workspace to which you want to export *topic_modeling* workflow in the drop-down menu.

4. In your workspace, open ``topic_modeling`` in ``WORKFLOWS`` tab. Select ``Run workflow with inputs defined by file paths`` as below

    .. image:: images/single_workflow.png

   and click the ``SAVE`` button.
